To use the WordCount MapReduce job on Hadoop,  you can use directly the .jar that we created from the command line on Ubuntu:
$hadoop jar <path to:WordCount.jar> WordCount /data/input.txt /output
Be careful that you need to put the full path to your copy of WordCount.jar.
You also need to create a directory with a new name for output each time you run a job.
